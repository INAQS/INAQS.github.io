    INAQS, The <a href="https://github.com/INAQS/inaqs_release">"Interface for Non-Adiabatic Quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics in Solvent"</a> allows one to run gas-phase or solvated (QM/MM with electronic embedding) dynamics using GROMACS for the dynamics and Q-Chem for the electronic structure. We support Born Oppenheimer MD on ground or excited state surfaces, Ehrenfest dynamics, and Fewest Switches Surface Hopping with optional decoherence.

INAQS is developed as a collaboration between the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Groningen. Work in the Netherlands is led by Dr. Maximilian Menger (m.f.s.j.menger@rug.nl) and in the United States by <a href="https://vale.science">Dr. Vale Cofer-Shabica</a> (valecs@sas.upenn.edu).
